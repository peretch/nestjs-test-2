# nestjs-test-2

Just trying stuff with nestJS again

## App idea

### _Used car pricing API_

- Users sign up with mail/password
- Users get an estimate of how much their car is worth based on the make/model/year/mileage
- Users can report what they sold their vehicles for
- Admins have to approve reported sales
